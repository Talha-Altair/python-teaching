1. Write a Python program to display the current date and time.

Code:-

import datetime
now = datetime.datetime.now()
print ("Current date and time : ")
print (now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))


2. Write a Python program to print the calendar of a given month and year.

Code:-

import calendar
y = int(input("Input the year : "))
m = int(input("Input the month : "))
print(calendar.month(y, m))

3. Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from user and generate a list and a tuple with those numbers.

Code:-

values = input("Input some comma seprated numbers : ")
list = values.split(",")
tuple = tuple(list)
print('List : ',list)
print('Tuple : ',tuple)

4. Write a Python program to get a new string from a given string where "Is" has been added to the front. If the given string already begins with "Is" then return the string unchanged.

Code:-

def new_string(str):
  if len(str) >= 2 and str[:2] == "Is":
    return str
  return "Is" + str

print(new_string("Array"))
print(new_string("IsEmpty"))

5. Write a Python program to get a string which is n (non-negative integer) copies of a given string.

code:-

def larger_string(str, n):
   result = ""
   for i in range(n):
      result = result + str
   return result

print(larger_string('abc', 2))
print(larger_string('.py', 3))

6. Write a Python program to check whether a specified value is contained in a group of values.

Code:-

def is_group_member(group_data, n):
   for value in group_data:
       if n == value:
           return True
   return False
print(is_group_member([1, 5, 8, 3], 3))
print(is_group_member([5, 8, 3], -1))

7. Write a Python program to create a histogram from a given list of integers.

Code:-

def histogram( items ):
    for n in items:
        output = ''
        times = n
        while( times > 0 ):
          output += '*'
          times = times - 1
        print(output)

histogram([2, 3, 6, 5])
